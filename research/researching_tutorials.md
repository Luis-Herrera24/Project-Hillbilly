researching common video game tutorials

- I'm doing this because I am new to game development and not familiar with what tutorial menus usually look like. I would like my tutorials to fit the theme of the game and provide a good "flow" without interrupting the gameplay.
- I expect to learn and draw inspiration from other video games on common practice when it comes to creating a tutorial menu.
- I expect to learn what the common layout of what a tutorial menu looks like, such as button placement, how much or how little information should be portrayed, etc. This will be reflected when creating scenes in the .tscn files.
- Tasks such as FER-68 Create Tutorial Menu with Buttons, and FER-71 Create Main Controls Menu, are reflective of this.

- The attachments with the photos that I drew inspiration for this from different games are on the Jira task
