- I designed the tutorial flow of the game. As the game progresses, there will be certain tutorials that will appear as the play does a certain action for the first time. 
	- For example, when the player pulls out a weapon for the first time, a tutorial will appear, showing how to switch weapons, reload, etc.
- I am doing this so that the user has a seamless gameplay, avoiding frustraiton, and doesn't waste time trying to figure out how to do specific things, and instead spend more time playing the game.
- I expect to learn how map out a game and see the gameplay from a bigger picture, understanding the balance between when a player should be taught things, and when they should be left to figure it out on their owm.
- I expect to map-out when the tutorials will appear, and from there, create specific scenes for each tutorial and writing the scripts for them.
- As of now, Task 71 - Create Main Controls Menu, as well as other tasks in the future, such as, Attack Controls, and possibly adding video demonstrations on how to do certain things, will be reflective of this research.

- the pdf attachment with the drawings of what mapped out are attached on the Jira task
